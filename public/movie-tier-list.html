<h1>The Best Movies According to Jos√©</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Knieves out</h3>
<p>Is the best mistery movie I've ever seen. I think that you're always at the edge of your seat getting surprised with the plot-twists that the move has for you.</p>

<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>You may think that this movie is a little chaotic at the beginning, but when your getting deeper in the story, you will be awesomed with how the director tells the story.</p>

<h3>Spongebob Squarepants The Movie</h3>
<p>It's just one of the movies that make me laugh the most of all time. I grew up with Spongebob Squarepants and I love the humor in this movie.</p>
